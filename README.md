##Fintech Case analysis
###Overview and Origin

    Name of company: Robinhood
    When was the company incorporated? The company was incorporated on April 18, 2013.
    Who are the founders of the company? The founders of the company, Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev, met at Stanford University.
    How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? The idea for the company came about after both Baiju and Vlad started selling trading software to hedge funds. They then began to realize that they were only helping the rich get richer and decided that they wanted to give everyone an easier way to participate in the financial system. They then moved to California and built a trading software that allowed anyone with internet connection to trade stocks without getting charged a commission on every trade.
    How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? Robinhood is funded by venture capital investments such as DST Capital, New Enterprise Associates, Index Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. Over the last year they have received about 1.3 billion dollars which has increased their valuation to 12 billion dollars. Robinhood also makes its by getting rebates from market makers since when they buy the stock from them it is usually at a cheaper price then the exchange price. Also, they offer stock loans and by issuing a Robinhood credit card thru Sutton bank. They also generate income from uninvested cash and by offering a powerful investing to Robinhood gold.

### Business Activities:

    What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? Robinhood is trying to make investing “friendly, approachable, and understandable” for everyone. They want “Democratize Finance” by giving anyone with a smart phone access to the stock market. Before apps like Robinhood it was difficult for an average person to trade on the stock market.

    Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? The company’s intended customer is millennials, or people from around 21-39 years old. Most people in this age range use their cellphones daily which makes the perfect demographic for this company. They are looking for people that already have money that they can invest so the younger generation does not have the money to freely invest it and customers from the older generation may not be know how to properly use apps and smart phones. Robinhood has about 13 million users with that number climbing every day.
    What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Robinhood’s biggest advantage that they utilize is that they offer an easy-to-use app that does not have the confusing bells and whistles of other trading apps. This makes Robinhood much more attractive to the average person that may not know much about investing. If you wanted to set up an account and start trading it would only take a few minutes.

    Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stack share to find this information.) Application and Data • Python • React • NGINX • PostgreSQL • Bootstrap • Ubuntu • Redis • Amazon EC2 • Sass • Django • Redux • Kafka • RabbitMQ • Swift • Go • Kotlin • Memcached • Celery • Airflow • Rxjava • Faust Utilities • Google Analytics • Elasticsearch • Retrofit Devops • Github • Git • Docker • Jenkins • Kubernetes • Webpack • Kibana • Babel • Grafana • Sentry Business tools • Slack • G suite • Confluence • Asana

Robinhood uses all these programs to bring us the web and mobile app that we use to trade stocks and crypto currency. They use programs like React to build the user interface that we see every time we open the app or Python to manage the Data that is being sent into the application. They also use apps like Airflow to monitor the Data pipelines of stock and user information. The main goal that they have is to make an easy user interface that has all the financial data necessary to buy and sell stocks.
Landscape:

    What domain of the financial industry is the company in? Robinhood is considered a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer and a Stockbroker Electronic trading platform. In recent years they have expanded into crypto currency trading.
    What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? In the past 10 years the way stock trading is done has completely changed for example terminals have advanced so far that anyone with a computer can access Bloomberg or Reuters and get real time pricing of the market. Smartphones have also allowed anyone that has access to the internet be able to by and sell stocks. 50 years ago, Stock Traders had to be on site at the NYSE or the CME to make trades. Now with Personal finance apps on our Smart phones we can manage all our finance at the click of a button. One of the best innovations that allows Robinhood to succeed at such a high level is big data. The fact that they can access an insane amount of data to analyze had helped them make the best app possible. Big data has also helped the SEC regulate and manage our financial markets. The increase of online Brokers and rob-advisors has given people access to information that they never had before.
    What are the other major companies in this domain? The other major competitors in the domain are. • Webull • Trade Station • Sofi Active investing • TD Ameritrade • Moomoo • Charles Schwab • Public • Ally • E*TRADE

### Results

    What has been the business impact of this company so far? In 2020, we had a global pandemic that kept everyone at home, and most people had nothing to do. Once people started to receive stimulus checks, some people had extra money and no way to spend it. This is where Robinhood comes in and offers people and easy way to invest their money from the comfort of their homes. From January 2020 to April 2020 Robinhood gained over 3 million new accounts. This business model caused such a large impact because it gave a large group of amateur investors a way to easily invest their money. We can see an example of this with the GameStop and AMC stock. Millions of people came together to buy GameStop and AMC because they were getting short sold. This has terrified large investors and hedge funds because now they must worry about the impact of millions upon millions of people’s investing habits.

    What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? Companies in this domain measure success based on active users, total transactions, valuation, and payment-for-order-flow revenue. Based on these metrics Robinhood is performing very well because in 2020 they had a 514% increase in their payment-for-order-flow revenue by generating $682 million. Also, in the last 5 years Robinhood has gone from 0.5 million users to over 13 million users. Another very important metric total transactions are very important for a company like Robinhood, and they have more than doubled the amount from 150 million to 350 million since 2019. Robinhood has been valued at $20 billion in 2021 and based on that metric they have been very successful.

    How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? Webull has around 11 million active users and is valued at 1 billion dollars by Bloomberg. TD Ameritrade has 11 million client accounts with more than 1 trillion in assets and has 4.358 billion in total revenue in Q3 of 2020. Ally has around 4.5 million customers and had a revenue of 6.394 billion in 2019. Overall, Robinhood has been performing better in their active users category but their competitors are not far behind. If they want to stay ahead, they need to innovate and offer something that no other investment app offers.

### Recommendations

    If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination! My suggestion to Robinhood would be since it is so easy to sign up and start trading on their app, I would suggest they start using a program called Alloy to help “make better decisions using a single API and dashboard to manage KYC/AML and fraud.
    Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Alloy allows Robinhood to safely onboard new customers and automate the decisions on whether to accept the. This will help reduce fraud by reducing the number of fake accounts or stolen names being used on the app. By preventing fraud before it happens Robinhood will save themselves tons of money trying to fix these issues. Also, if people know that their information is safer when signing up more customers will be encouraged to do the same.
    What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? This product would utilize a single API called Alloy. It also includes technologies like iovation, source, Comply advantage, Acuant, Ekata, Cognito.
    Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution. These technologies are appropriate for my solution because they help Robinhood reduce fraud when customers are signing up for the app. Comply advantage helps Robinhood make intelligent risk decisions when it comes to new and existing customers. Also, Acuant is a next gen identity platform that uses AI to help reduce fraud. Another technology that will help Robinhood is Cognito because its an easy way to verify someone’s identity by name and phone number. Overall, I think that these technologies will help make people more comfortable when putting their information into the app, since they know that it’s safe against fraud.
